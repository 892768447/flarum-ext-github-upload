# Github Upload by Irony

An extension that upload file to github, which supports auto embedding images and videos

### Installation

for beta 15 and latter
```sh
composer require irony/flarum-ext-github-upload:dev-master
```

### Notice
Flarum is beautiful, but I don't use it anymore, and it changes so often that it's difficult to maintain plug-ins
